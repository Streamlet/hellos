# HellOS

`HellOS` stands for "Hello, OS!". As its name suggests, it is an OS for learning and practice.

## Getting Started

### Environment

* Shell:  Bash on Linux/WSL or MSYS2/MinGW on Windows
* Assemble: NASM
* C Compile: OpenWatcom (16-bit), GCC(32-bit)
* Disk Tools: `fdisk` (from util-linux), `mkfs.fat` (from dosfstools), `mcopy`(from mtools)
* VM: QEMU

### Steps

 1. Go to a target directory (e.g. `src/boot/hello`).
 2. Run `build.sh`, or `make` if `makefile` exists. This will assemble the .asm files and compile any .c files, producing the necessary binary files (.bin, etc.).
 3. Run `mkdisk.sh` if exists, or `make disk` if `makefile` exists. This will create the virtual disk images (.img files) needed for booting.
 4. Run `run.sh` or `make run` if `makefile` exists. This will start QEMU and boot the target Bootloader/OS.

Example using `src/boot/hello`:

```sh
cd src/boot/hello
./build.sh
./run.sh
```
